- zig documentation is now correctly linked.

## 0.1.2

- updated documentation for `mix zig_doc`

- added better compilation failures for bad types in args and retvals
- added `beam` struct support for ok and error tuples

## 0.1.3

- added ok/error tuple with string
- added c header path support
- restored documentation for exceptions

## 0.2.0

- general rewrite of nif parsing routines
- initial support for resources
- experimental addition of `:dirty`, `:long` and `:safe` function directives

## 0.3.0-pre

- supported zig version: 0.6.0
- disabled `:long` mode

## 0.3.0-pre3

- support for (and autodetect) nerves
- use erlang nif headers taken from the `include` directory of your erts.
- correct and verified support for releases
- adds a mechanism for patching errors in zig/llvm releases
- adds ~z for substituted values
- zigler fetches zig on compile when it's in prod.

## 0.3.0

- verified that zig tests run correctly
- updated documentation.
  - preliminary "under the hood" category.

## 0.3.1

- support for `amd64` in freebsd, (thanks @dch)

## 0.3.2

- better support for nerves (thanks @fhunleth)
- fixed documentation linking for bootstrap

## 0.7.1
- upgraded to zig 0.7.1.  From now on zigler version numbers will track Zig releases.
- completed implementation of `threaded` nifs.
- makes the interface to `beam.send` simpler and less confusing.
- adds extra atom/tuple directives
- **important:** changes the base module namespace from `Zigler` to `Zig`
- readme and guides are now checked.
- libraries are now brought into the staging directory.
- unblocked windows compilation path.  There are still some bugs. Thanks @seomwan
- regressions:
  - Nerves support will have to be dropped until arm32 is tier 1.  Use 0.3.2.
  - zigtests do not seem to work when libraries are loaded

## 0.7.2
- **note:** this compiles with zig 0.7.1
- **important (breaking):** semantics for `beam.yield` have changed.
  there is no longer any need to update the environment of the yielding
  function, and `beam.yield()` now returns `!void`
- `beam.yield` is safely usable in non-yielding nifs.
- Zigler now no longer automatically links libc.  This may cause
  compilation problems on non-linux platforms.  Please post any bug
  reports to github tracker.
- thanks to (@dch and @wojtekmach for updating some dependency issues)

## 0.7.3
- **note:** this compiles with zig 0.7.1
- better platform matching for nerves cross-compliation (@fhunleth)

## 0.8.1
- `beam.assert` deprecated.  Use `std.testing` functions.
- support for error-returning functions and error return traces merged with stacktraces.
- support for cancellation of threaded nifs with `beam.yield`
- better support for 'bring your own zig'; moved to library config function
- tentative support for MacOS and FreeBSD targets
- `void` returning functions now output `:ok` instead of `nil`
